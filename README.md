fantasy-pick
============

An EPL fantasy league team picker.

I wrote this to search for an optimal fantasy league team based on price/performance stats from the previous season.

The data was copied from the EPL fantasy league website at the start of the 2012-2013 season before gameweek 1.

This code is released free to use for any purpose, but I would appreciate credit and a link to my github repository
if you use this in some project.
